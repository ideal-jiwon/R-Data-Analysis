# Structure for Mid-Term Data Analysis Project Report

Before beginning, remember that a data analysis report is written for a client and should address the challenges faced by said client. It would be best not to look at this report as a term paper in a class or a report about a subject, but instead as a report you would do for a real client during your career. This document is meant, primarily, to start an organized conversation between you and your client. Such a report also must be provided to your higher-ups when you join an organization.


## 1. Introduction. The introductions should include

In the introduction to your report, describe the problem. What substantive question are you trying to address? Give a summary of the study and data, as well as any relevant substantive context, background, or framing issues. List the “big questions” answered by your data analyses and give summaries of your conclusions about these questions. Lastly, give a brief outline of the remainder of the paper. For example, we will cover the data and model section, the conclusions and discussion, the appendices, and more.

## 2. Data and Model

For every analysis, start with the question you want to address, then provide a detailed response using data, the methods used, and, finally, the results. To do so, you can format the section like this:
* Data
* Method
* Analysis
* Results

Or, alternatively, like this:

“Big Question”

* Data
* Method
* Analysis
* Results

“Big Question”
* Etc.

Bulleted lists should be used sparingly—they are most effective for ideas that are less than two lines long. When organizing paragraphs, use headers (described below) instead of bullet points.

### A Note on Headers and Sub-Headers

Over the course of this paper, but especially in the Data and Model section, remember to use the proper formatting for the different levels of headers for your information. If you are using Microsoft Word, these formats are available in the “Styles” section of the Home tab, labelled Heading 1 – 5. Examples are listed below, along with other formatting reminders:

# Header1 
## Header 2 
### Header 3 
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

* unordered list
 + sub-item 1
 + sub-item 2
 - sub-sub-item 1 

*italics* and **bold** 
***bold with italics***

## 3.	Conclusion(s)/Discussion. 

The conclusion should reprise the questions and conclusions of the introduction, augmented by some additional observations or details gleaned from the analysis section. New questions, future work, etc., can also be provided in this section. Make sure that you are including new information and not simply repeating yourself. What do you recommend for the company based on this information? What can you learn, and what might be the best path to take given what you know?

You might also want to think about what issues might arise from the information you collected. Are there unforeseen variables that might affect the data in unexpected ways? Are there any additional data you might recommend gathering to help support your position and rule out other possibilities?


## 4.	Appendix/Appendices. 

Here, you will provide in-depth information on detailed tables from the R output, plots from the R output, and R commands. 


**Remove the following set of code before your generate the file**

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the dropdown button along with the **Knit** icon and choose Knit to word. A word document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You are expected to generate R You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
cars
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
